## Indirect Submission - Annotated List

My project is about an intuitive derivation of Entropy, and why it shows up in physics and information theory. 

All submissions below are identical. The first two links are the cleanest and easiest to read. 

- It is hosted on my blog at: https://hasanmohsin.github.io/CSC412-ComSciCom-Entropy/
- I have submitted a link to the same blog post on the course forum: https://probml-forum.jessebett.com/t/my-submission-trying-to-understand-entropy/1846
- I have also submitted a pdf + .md copy on Markus as a backup in case the link fails (although all figures are my own, I was unsure how to submit them on Markus)
